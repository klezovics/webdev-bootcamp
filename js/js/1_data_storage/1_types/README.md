JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, which means that variables can hold values of different types throughout their lifetime. JavaScript has several built-in types, which include:

1. **Primitive Types:**
    - **Number**: Represents numeric values. It can be either an integer or a floating-point number.
    - **String**: Represents textual data enclosed in single quotes ('') or double quotes ("").
    - **Boolean**: Represents either `true` or `false`.
    - **Undefined**: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
    - **Null**: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
    - **Symbol**: Represents a unique identifier. Symbols are primarily used to create property keys that are not accessible by regular iteration.

2. **Complex Types:**
    - **Object**: Represents a collection of key-value pairs and is one of the fundamental data structures in JavaScript. Objects can be created using the object literal syntax `{}` or by using the `new` keyword with constructor functions.
    - **Array**: Represents an ordered list of values enclosed in square brackets ([]). Arrays can contain elements of any type, and their indices start from zero.
    - **Function**: Represents reusable blocks of code that can be invoked by name. Functions can be defined using the `function` keyword or by using arrow functions (introduced in ECMAScript 6).
