Certainly! Here are the key methods for the JavaScript data containers you mentioned: arrays, maps, objects, and sets.

**Arrays:**
Arrays are ordered collections of elements.

- **push**: Adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
- **pop**: Removes the last element from an array and returns that element.
- **shift**: Removes the first element from an array and returns that element. It also shifts all subsequent elements down to a lower index.
- **unshift**: Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.
- **concat**: Combines two or more arrays and returns a new array.
- **slice**: Extracts a section of an array and returns a new array without modifying the original.
- **splice**: Changes the contents of an array by removing, replacing, or adding elements in place.
- **forEach**: Executes a provided function once for each array element.
- **map**: Creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array.
- **filter**: Creates a new array with all elements that pass a test provided by a provided function.
- **find**: Returns the first element in the array that satisfies a provided testing function.
- **reduce**: Applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array to reduce it to a single value.

**Maps:**
Maps are collections of key-value pairs.

- **set**: Adds or updates a key-value pair in the map.
- **get**: Retrieves the value associated with a specific key from the map.
- **has**: Checks if a specific key exists in the map.
- **delete**: Removes a key-value pair from the map.
- **clear**: Removes all key-value pairs from the map.
- **size**: Returns the number of key-value pairs in the map.
- **forEach**: Executes a provided function once for each key-value pair in the map.

**Objects:**
Objects are collections of properties represented as key-value pairs.

- **dot notation**: Accesses object properties using dot notation (e.g., `object.property`).
- **bracket notation**: Accesses object properties using bracket notation (e.g., `object['property']`).
- **Object.keys**: Returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names.
- **Object.values**: Returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property values.
- **Object.entries**: Returns an array of a given object's own enumerable key-value pairs.
- **Object.assign**: Copies the values of all enumerable properties from one or more source objects to a target object.
- **Object.hasOwnProperty**: Checks if an object has a specific property as its own property.

**Sets:**
Sets are collections of unique elements.

- **add**: Adds an element to the set.
- **has**: Checks if a specific element exists in the set.
- **delete**: Removes an element from the set.
- **clear**: Removes all elements from the set.
- **size**: Returns the number of elements in the set.
- **forEach**: Executes a provided function once for each element in the set.

These are just some of the key methods available for working with arrays, maps, objects, and sets in JavaScript. Each data container provides a range of methods to manipulate and interact with the data it holds, allowing for efficient data management in different scenarios.
