Implement the following functions using if/else statements.
The solution function to each problem should be implemeneted like

function problemX() {
}

1. Write a function that takes an integer as input and returns "positive" if it's greater than zero, "negative" if it's less than zero, and "zero" if it's equal to zero.

2. Write a function that takes two numbers as input and returns the larger of the two numbers.

3. Write a function that takes a number as input and returns "even" if it's divisible by 2, and "odd" otherwise.

4 Write a function that takes a month (as a number from 1 to 12) as input and returns the corresponding name of the month.

5 Write a function that takes a string as input and returns "long" if the length of the string is greater than 5, and "short" otherwise.

6 Write a function that takes a grade (as a number from 0 to 100) as input and returns "pass" if the grade is 60 or higher, and "fail" otherwise.

7 Write a function that takes three numbers as input and returns the sum of the positive numbers.

8 Write a function that takes a character as input and returns "vowel" if it's a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), and "consonant" otherwise.

9 Write a function that takes a number as input and returns "positive even" if it's a positive even number, "positive odd" if it's a positive odd number, "negative even" if it's a negative even number, and "negative odd" if it's a negative odd number.

10 Write a function that takes a day of the week (as a number from 1 to 7) as input and returns "weekend" if it's Saturday or Sunday, and "weekday" otherwise.

11 Write a function that takes two strings as input and returns "equal" if they are identical, and "not equal" otherwise.

12 Write a function that takes a number as input and returns "prime" if it's a prime number, and "composite" otherwise.

13 Write a function that takes an age as input and returns "child" if it's less than 12, "teenager" if it's between 12 and 19, and "adult" if it's 20 or older.

14 Write a function that takes three numbers as input and returns the product of the smallest two numbers.

15 Write a function that takes a year as input and returns "leap year" if it's a leap year (divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, unless also divisible by 400), and "not a leap year" otherwise.

16 Write a function that takes a number as input and returns "positive" if it's positive, "negative" if it's negative, and "zero" if it's zero, using a switch statement.

17 Write a function that takes a grade (as a number from 0 to 100) as input and returns "A" if the grade is between 90 and 100, "B" if it's between 80 and 89, "C" if it's between 70 and 79, "D" if it's between 60 and 69, and "F" if it's less than 60, using a switch statement.

18 Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the reverse of the string, but only if the string length is greater than 5; otherwise, return the original string.

19 Write a function that takes a number as input and returns "even and divisible by 3" if it's even and divisible by
