Introduction to JavaScript Classes for Junior Developers

In JavaScript, classes are a way to define blueprints for creating objects. They provide a structured and organized approach to object-oriented programming. Here's a simple introduction to JavaScript classes, along with code examples for each concept.

1. Class Declaration:
   Classes are declared using the `class` keyword, followed by the class name. They serve as a blueprint for creating objects of that class.

   ```javascript
   class Person {
     // class members go here
   }
   ```

2. Constructor:
   The constructor is a special method that is called when a new object is created from a class. It initializes the object's properties.

   ```javascript
   class Person {
     constructor(name, age) {
       this.name = name;
       this.age = age;
     }
   }
   ```

3. Properties:
   Properties are variables that store the state or characteristics of an object. They are defined inside the class and accessed using the `this` keyword.

   ```javascript
   class Person {
     constructor(name, age) {
       this.name = name;
       this.age = age;
     }
   }
   ```

4. Methods:
   Methods are functions that define the behavior or actions of an object. They are defined inside the class and can be called on objects created from that class.

   ```javascript
   class Person {
     constructor(name, age) {
       this.name = name;
       this.age = age;
     }

     greet() {
       console.log(
         `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`
       );
     }
   }
   ```

5. Creating Objects:
   Objects can be created from a class using the `new` keyword, followed by the class name and any required arguments for the constructor.

   ```javascript
   const person1 = new Person("John Doe", 25);
   const person2 = new Person("Jane Smith", 30);
   ```

6. Inheritance:
   Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. It promotes code reuse and supports the concept of "is-a" relationships.

   ```javascript
   class Student extends Person {
     constructor(name, age, grade) {
       super(name, age);
       this.grade = grade;
     }

     study() {
       console.log(
         `${this.name} is studying hard for the ${this.grade} grade.`
       );
     }
   }
   ```

7. Static Methods:
   Static methods are class-level methods that are called on the class itself, rather than on objects created from the class. They are defined using the `static` keyword.

   ```javascript
   class MathUtils {
     static add(a, b) {
       return a + b;
     }
   }

   const result = MathUtils.add(3, 5); // result = 8
   ```

These are some basic concepts of JavaScript classes. They provide a foundation for creating reusable and structured code. As you progress, you can explore more advanced topics like class inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to further enhance your object-oriented programming skills.
