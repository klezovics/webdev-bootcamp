Ultimately CSS, when applied to an element, allows you to control the following aspects:

1. Element position in the page
2. Element size and size of its part: i.e. margin, border
3. Color of the element and its parts
4. Typography
5. Add a bit of animation to the element
6. Position of elements children within it

The file in this lesson, shows you how you can do a bit of all of the above.
